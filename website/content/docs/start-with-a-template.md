Netlify CMS can be [added to an existing site](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/add-to-your-site), but the quickest way to get started is with a template. Our featured templates below deploy to Netlify, giving you a fully working CMS-enabled site with just a few clicks.

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-around; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
    <div>
        <h4>Hugo Site Starter</h4>
        <p><a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/netlify-templates/one-click-hugo-cms&amp;stack=cms"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify" /></a></p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Gatsby Site Starter</h4>
        <p><a href="https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/AustinGreen/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms&amp;stack=cms"><img src="https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg" alt="Deploy to Netlify" /></a></p>
    </div>

After clicking one of those buttons, you’ll authenticate with GitHub and choose a repository name. Netlify will then automatically create a repository in your GitHub account with a copy of the files from the template. Next, it will build and deploy the new site on Netlify, bringing you to the site dashboard when the build is complete.


## Access Netlify CMS on your new site

1. The template deploy process will send you an invitation to your new site, sent from `no-reply@netlify.com`.

    ![Sample email subject line: You've been invited to join radiologist-amanda-53841.netlify.com](https://www.netlifycms.org/img/email-subject.png?raw=true)

2. Click the link to accept the invite, and you’ll be directed to your site, with a prompt to create a password.

    !["Complete your signup" modal on the Kaldi coffee site](https://www.netlifycms.org/img/create-password.png?raw=true)

3. Enter a password, sign in, and you’ll be directed straight to the CMS. (For future visits, you can go straight to `<yoursiteaddress.com>/admin/`.)

Try adding and editing posts, or changing the content of the Products page. When you save, the changes will be pushed immediately to GitHub, triggering a build on Netlify, and updating the content on your site. Check out the configuration code by visiting your site repo.
